**Hi and welcome to my little page about the Anycubic Kobra Go and Neo.**  
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a Kobra Neo from a friend of mine.  
As it came with some minor problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the Neo. It turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family - most of the (still rare) informations were about the Kobra Go. So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the Go and Neo, as they are basically the same - looking at the hardware, afaik the only difference is the print head / extruder (Go has a bowden and Neo has a direct drive extruder).  
  
This page isn't supposed to discuss individual problems like "I still get stringing, what can I do?" - therefore many forums exist. It's also not supposed to be a beginner's guide to 3D printing - there are countless guides and tutorials out there.  
It's supposed to be seen as a source of informations for these two specific 3D printer models, which includes general informations about the hardware, firmware, mods and links to further sources.  
  
However, if you've found out certain settings which work in general (e.g. certain g-codes for the stop/end section), if you discovered mods which aren't listed here or if you found out that certain things just don't work or even harm the printer - you're more than welcome to share them. If you'd like to contribute - please let me know.  
You don't necessarily need a GitHub account for it if you don't want to register here for free, just send me an email to  <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` </br> and we'll figure something out.   
  
May these informations help some newbies like me to get off better from the start and to take care of problems like a broken thermistor or a broken heating element of the extruder or even a broken mainboard (which happened to me all together - nice start).  
  
Happy printing!

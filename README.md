Informations and tips for the Anycubic Kobra Go and Neo to get off better from the start.

**Hi and welcome to my little page about the Anycubic Kobra Go and Neo.**  
  
I am a newbie to 3d printing and got a Kobra Neo from a friend of mine.  
As it came with some minor problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the Neo. It turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family - most of the (still rare) informations were about the Kobra Go. So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the Go and Neo, as they are basically the same - looking at the hardware, afaik the only difference is the print head (Go has bowden and Neo has direct drive).  
  
May these informations help some newbies like me to get off better from the start and to take care of problems like a broken thermistor or a broken heating element of the extruder or even a broken mainboard (which happened to me all together).  
  
Happy printing!

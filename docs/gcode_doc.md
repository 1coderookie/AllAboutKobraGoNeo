# G-Code

I don't really offer a g-code *table* here, but here you can find the links to comprehensive sources about the g-codes.  
  
The first one to mention is the [RepRap Wiki](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code), where you can find a general explanation about what g-code is, how it works and all the [g-commands](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G-commands). Within the g-commands section you also see a table which firmware (Marlin/Klipper/RepRap/Repetier/Smoothie) supports the specific code. 
   
## Marlin 
You can find a complete reference at the belonging [Marlin website](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/).  
  
## Klipper 
Besides the standard g-code, Klipper uses so called "extended" g-code commands for general status and configuration. These extended commands start with a command which may be followed by one or more parameters. You can find the whole reference at the [Klipper documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html) page about g-codes.

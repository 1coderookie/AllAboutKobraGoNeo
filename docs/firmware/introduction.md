# Introduction
Here you'll find further informations about the [stock firmware](fw_marlin.md) of both the **Go** and the **Neo** - like how to install updates, informations about specific settings and known restrictions.  
  
However, you might want to give [Klipper](fw_klipper.md) a try though, as it offers additional features like Pressure Advance and Input Shaping and offers much more possibilities to customize your firmware settings.

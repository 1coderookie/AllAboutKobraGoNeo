# Stock Firmware (Marlin Based) 
The official stock firmware for both models is based on the [Marlin firmware](https://marlinfw.org/).  
  
You can either  

- download the necessary `firmware.bin` file at [Anycubic's firmware & software page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) for the specific printer or  
- download the source code from their specific GitHub repositories to compile your own:  
  - [Kobra Go GitHub repository](https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/Kobra_Go)  
  - [Kobra Neo GitHub repository](https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/Kobra_Neo)  
   
At the time of writing this (January 2023) the available `firmware.bin` files at the support page of Anycubic's website were older versions than the source code ones they offer at their GitHub Account.  
  
In case you want to build and compile your own `firmware.bin` file, you can follow the instructions of @[jojos38](https://github.com/jojos38) [Tutorial: How to build Anycubic Marlin sourcecode into a firmware.bin](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/y2waxu/tutorial_how_to_build_anycubic_marlin_source_code/).

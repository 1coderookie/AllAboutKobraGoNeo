# Stock Firmware (Marlin Based) 
The official stock firmware for both models is based on the [Marlin firmware](https://marlinfw.org/).  
  
You can either  

- download the necessary `firmware.bin` file at [Anycubic's firmware & software page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) for the specific printer or  
- download the source code from their specific GitHub repositories to compile your own:  
    - [Kobra Go GitHub repository](https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/Kobra_Go)  
    - [Kobra Neo GitHub repository](https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/Kobra_Neo)  
     
In case you want to build and compile your own `firmware.bin` file, you can follow the instructions of @[jojos38](https://github.com/jojos38) [Tutorial: How to build Anycubic Marlin sourcecode into a firmware.bin](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/y2waxu/tutorial_how_to_build_anycubic_marlin_source_code/).

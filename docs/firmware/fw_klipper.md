# Klipper (Mod)  
  
Can you run [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) on the stock mainboard? Yes you can!  
The stock mainboard of the **Go** and the **Neo** is the same, also the procedure of compiling and flashing Klipper is. However, you have to adjust certain settings depending on your specific model.

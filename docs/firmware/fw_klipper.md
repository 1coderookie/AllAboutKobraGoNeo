# Klipper (Mod)  
  
Can you run [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/) on the stock mainboard? Well - it seems that you can!  
    
Reddit user [xpeng121](https://www.reddit.com/user/xpeng121/) postet a description about how to get it done: [Install Klipper on Kobra Go or Neo](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/10cwm16/install_klipper_on_kobra_go_or_neo/)

!!! warning  
  
    Keep in mind that even though the stock mainboard of the **Go** and the **Neo** is the same, you have to adjust certain settings of the Klipper configuration depending on your specific model!

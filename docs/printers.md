# Printers
The Anycubic [Kobra **Go**](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/3d-printers/products/kobra-go) and [Kobra **Neo**](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/3d-printers/products/kobra-neo) are pretty much identical FDM bed slinger printers, the only real difference seems to be the different type of extruder:  
* The Kobra **Go** uses a bowden drive extruder.  
* The Kobra **Neo** uses a direct drive extruder.  
The price of the **Go** usually is a bit lower than the price of the **Neo**.  
The **Go** comes completely unmounted so you have to mount everything together by yourself. The Kobra **Neo** comes pre-mounted, you only have to mount a few parts like the frame for the x-axis (where the printhead is mounted to) onto the base frame.  
  
See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/blogs/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-kobra-series) of the Kobra series to find manuals, firmware, video tutorials and more o f both the **Go** and the **Neo**.

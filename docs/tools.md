# Tools 
When it comes down to tinkering, the fun factor and the results raise and fall with the tools you have. So if you're new to this whole world and find yourself in front of an empty toolbox, the following tools might be a good start.  
  
??? tip "Quality Matters"

    If you're about to buy tools, you're probably tempted to get yourself cheap tools (which might be ok for certain parts tho). However, I personally just want to give you the advise to spend a bit more and get yourself some quality tools from well known brands. Yes, you might pay the same amount of money for one good wrench then you'd pay for a whole set, but believe me, it'll be worth it. Quality tools are made more precisely and from better material. <br> So let's say you want to get yourself some hexagon socket tools, don't go for the cheapest ones out there. The cheap ones tend to become round on the edges pretty quick and it's really no fun at all to fiddle around with a 1.5mm hexagon socket tool trying to loosen up that little grub screw of the heater block with a messed up tool. 
    
The following list will be extended by time.  

- Hexagon socket tools <br> You already got some of them with the printer I guess, but it's probably a good idea to get yourself some quality ones.  
- Wrench / adjustable wrench / socket wrench <br> For tinkering at the Go/Neo, you don't necessarily need a whole set of wrenches as most of the screws are hexagon socket ones. However, I recommend to get yourself at least a sufficient one for the nozzle and one which fits the heater block. For the nozzle you can also use a socket wrench and for the heater block you could use a little adjustable wrench - just make sure that you don't get yourself a huge one as it might be hard to get around with that due to a bit of a limited space. <br> I highly recommend to use a wrench instead of just some universal pair of pliers as the wrench fits the object perfectly and doesn't harm it because of the smooth surface.
- Soldering iron <br> It's always good to have a soldering iron because it allows you to solder wires together and so on. If you don't have one yet, don't go for a big one. I personally love my little 12W "Weller Mini" as it is thin and good to grab and parts don't tend to overheat quickly as it could happen when you use a 40W or 80W iron for example. However, there are soldering stations out there which allow you to adjust the power and the heat and which also offer a small hand piece, so I'd recommend you go for something like that. <br> However, make sure you'll have a fine tip as it makes it easier to fix tiny parts. 
- Silicone mat <br> Speaking about soldering irons, I personally use a silicone mat to put it on the table to protect the surface.

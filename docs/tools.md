# Tools 
When it comes down to tinkering, the fun factor and the results raise and fall with the tools you have. So if you're new to this whole world and find yourself in front of an empty toolbox, the following tools might be a good start (the list will be extended by time).  
  
??? tip "Quality Matters"

    If you're about to buy tools, you're probably tempted to get yourself cheap tools (which might be ok for certain parts tho). However, I personally just want to give you the advise to spend a bit more and get yourself some quality tools from well known brands. Yes, you might pay the same amount of money for one good wrench then you'd pay for a whole set, but believe me, it'll be worth it. Quality tools are made more precisely and from better material so they just last longer.  
    So let's say you want to get yourself some hexagon socket tools, don't go for the cheapest ones out there. The cheap ones tend to become round on the edges pretty quick and it's really no fun at all to fiddle around with a 1.5mm hexagon socket tool trying to loosen up that little grub screw of the heater block with a messed up tool. Doing so, you could even harm the socket of the screw which could/would result in the fact that you either won't be able to get it out at all or that you'd have to replace it with a new one (which might be hard to find).  
     

## Multimeter
Get yourself a multimeter. You don't have to get a professional one, a cheap multimeter will do the job just fine. You'll need a multimeter to measure voltage and current and to measure if maybe a wire is broken somewhere. You can also measure if your limit switch is faulty or if a sensor or a thermistor is working correct.  

## Hexagon Socket Tools 
You already got some of them with the printer I guess, but it's probably a good idea to get yourself some quality ones.  

## Wrench 
For tinkering at the Go/Neo, you don't necessarily need a whole set of wrenches as most of the screws are hexagon socket ones. However, I recommend to get yourself at least a sufficient one for the nozzle and one which fits the heater block.  
For the nozzle you can also use a socket wrench and for the heater block you could use a little adjustable wrench - just make sure that you don't get yourself a huge one as it might be hard to get around with that due to a bit of a limited space.  

!!! tip

    I highly recommend to use a wrench instead of just some universal pair of pliers as the wrench fits the object perfectly and doesn't harm it because of its smooth surface.  

## Soldering Iron 
It's always good to have a soldering iron because it allows you to solder wires together and so on. If you don't have one yet, don't go for a big one. I personally love my little 12W "Weller Mini" as it is thin and good to grab and parts don't tend to overheat quickly as it could happen when you use a 40W or 80W iron for example.  
There are well-priced soldering stations out there which allow you to adjust the power and the heat and which also offer a small hand piece, so I'd recommend you go for something like that. They usually also include a holder for the hot iron and something like a brass sponge or so to clean the tip.   
However, make sure you'll have a fine tip as it makes it easier to fix tiny parts.  

## Hot Air Gun
A hot air gun comes in handy if you have to disassamble your hotend after you've already taken it out of the printhead or in case you cartridge heater and/or thermistor is broken and therefore you can't use the heating function of the printer itself.  
You could either use a 'big' heat gun like the ones from the tool shop and put a 'minimizer' on top of it which concentrates the airflow (sorry, I don't how these things are called..) or you get yourself a hot air gun station which is used to solder SMD with. Here it's nice to be able to set the desired temperature and the little 'nozzles' for it make it easy to concentrate the heat flow where it should go.  

## Silicone Mat 
Speaking about soldering irons and hot air guns, I personally use a silicone mat to put it on the table to protect the surface.  

## Needles for the Nozzles
Get yourself some of those long acupuncture needles which fit the diameter of your nozzle. Maybe one of those for the stock 0.4mm nozzle already came with the printer. 

!!! tip

    *Always* use them when the nozzle is warm though as they tend to bend or even break if you try to push it into the cold nozzle where the hardened filament sticks in.  

## Small Drills
I personally like to use a 1.5mm and 2mm drill which is longer than a regular one to clean up a clogged PTFE tube of the heat break. First you stick a needle as far as you can into the warm nozzle which fits the diameter of the nozzle, then you disassamble the extruder and take out the PTFE tube. The little hole the needle created inside of the clogged tube leads the 1.5mm drill perfectly fine. After you went through with that one, switch to the 2mm drill and give it a good last cleaning.  
However, make sure you only use these drills for this specific purpose as you don't want to have some metal or wood chips sticking on the which then may stay in the tube.  

!!! tip 

    *Always* use the drill by hand - don't use your electric power drill for that as you might harm the tube!

## Tweezers
Get yourself some long handled tweezers, preferably a few different ones with different shaped and bent tips.  

## Ferrules & Specific Pliers
Being able to add ferrules to the end of wires is just great. You can get them as a set with the specific pliers for that and it's not even expensive. When you're looking out for that, make sure to get those kind of pliers which use four brackets to squeeze the ferrules and which engage during squeezing. The results will be much better than the ones that just use two brackets. Especially when it comes down to small ferrules it's also much easier to take out the ferrules afterwards as they don't stick in one side of the jaw.

## Cable Ties
Get yourself some of those small cable ties, it's always good to have some of them laying around in your toolbox.

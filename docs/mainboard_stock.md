# The Stock Mainboard  
  
The mainboard of both the Go and the Neo is the "TriGorilla V_3.0.6", it's just flashed with the respective fimware of either model. That means if you e.g. own a Neo and can't get a mainboard for it (at the time of writing this, Anycubic only offers the mainboard for Go in their shop) or if you find a seller but he charges more for the Neo version - just go for the Go version and flash it with the firmware for the Neo.

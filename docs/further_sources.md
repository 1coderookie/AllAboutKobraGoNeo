# Further Sources of Information

Here of course the [Anycubic website](https://www.anycubic.com) has to be mentioned first.  
You can find [manuals and firmware](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) at their support page.  
They also produced some video tutorials about e.g. changing the printhead or the mainboard for the **Go** and the **Neo**. You can find them at their [guide videos page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/guide-videos).  
Pretty much all of these informations are also available at their [blog page](https://www.anycubic.com/blogs/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-kobra-series).  
  
There are many great websites and YouTube channels out there and if you're already into this whole 3D printing thing, you probably already have your favourites. So it's hard for me to recommend any. However, if you're new to this whole thing like I am (or if you've never heard of one of the following), I'd recommend taking a look at the following sources to gather informations:  

- [Website of All3DP](https://all3dp.com/)
- [Website of Thomas Sanladerer](https://toms3d.org/) and [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thomassanladerer) 
- (more to come)

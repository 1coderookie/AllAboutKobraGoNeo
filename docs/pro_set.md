# Profiles & Settings

The microSD card shipped with your printer should contain a file with a Cura profile. If you don't have it, you can download it at [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software).  
However, this profile doesn't always work right away, even though it's a good start. The profile and specific settings may differ from printer to printer, even within the same model type. The settings like print speed, layer height, extruder and bed temperature and so on also depend on the type of material you want to use (e.g. PLA/ABS/PETG/TPU). But also for the same type of filament material like PLA the settings often need to be adjusted again if you're using filament of a different manufacturer or even just another spool of the same brand. There are countless guides about this topic in general, so I'd recommend to dig into it deeper using your preferred sites or specific videos.   
  
However, there are users who offer their profiles for the Go and Neo, so that beginners have a better starting point. In the following I'll list them as far as I'm aware of them. Be aware though that you still have to check the settings and finetune them for your device.  
  
## Go  
  
??? question "Got a Go?"

    Do you own a **Go** and created profiles for it which could be useful for other users as well? <br> Did you made them available somewhere? <br> If so, send me an email to <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` <br> and let me know about it, I'd be happy to set a link to it.   
  
## Neo  

- @sclebo05 offers his profiles for different slicers for the Kobra **Neo**: [https://github.com/sclebo05/KobraNeoProfiles](https://github.com/sclebo05/KobraNeoProfiles)

# TriGorilla V_3.0.6 (Stock) 
  
The stock mainboard of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is the "TriGorilla V_3.0.6", it's just flashed with the respective fimware of either model.

That means if you e.g. own a **Neo** and can't get a mainboard for it (at the time of writing this, Anycubic only offers the mainboard for the **Go** in their shop) or if you find a seller but he charges more for the **Neo** version - just go for the Go version and flash it with the firmware for the **Neo**.  
  
## Tips  
  
It's adivsable to cut off the soldered tips of the wires without a plug (power supply and heated bed) and add ferrules to them. When you are screwing down the soldered tip inside the clamp, it may get deformed a bit and in case the wire gets warm and the solder gets softer, the contact may become loose, which could lead to malfunction or even could cause fire in the last consequence. So it's alsways good to just use proper ferrules.

Shortcuts coming from the cartridge heater for example can/will damage your mainboard, so be careful to never cause a shortcut somehow. A common misbehaviour is to clean the nozzle with a little brass brush during the print process or while everything is heating up. Also grabbing the heater block to e.g. change the nozzle while everything is heating up and current is flowing is another common mistake. By using the pliers to hold the heater block, the tips of the pliers may touch the contacts of wires at the cartridge heater and you cause a shortcut. As a result you can/will get blown up part at the mainboard like the melted part "D4" as shown in the picture below.

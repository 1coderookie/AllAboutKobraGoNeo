# Axes

## X-Axis
The X-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is belt driven, the motor which drives the belt is located at the left side.  
You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the right side of the aluminum profile where the printhead is guided onto.

### Belt Tension
It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that. Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft - if it's too loose though, the belt might slip. If you can 'bend' the belt down a bit by putting a some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel an amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. If you pluck it like a guitar string then it should make something like a mid to high sound.  

??? tip "Belt Maintenance"

    - Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. 
    - Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.
    - Check if you can see any cracks at the belt. 
    - Check the gear wheels of the motors which are driving the belts. Are they also looking ok? Did they become loose on the motor shaft somehow?  

### V Slot Wheels Position
The wheels are leading the bed onto the aluminum profile in the middle. They run in the V-slot of the profile and therefore they should sit in a good position. Means, they shouldn't sit too tight in the V-slot but also not too loose - they should be able to roll and move freely, but they shouldn't be too far away from the profile which would lead to instability.  
You can adjust the roller tension by turning the eccentric nut which moves the wheels either towards or away from the aluminum profile. Not all of the wheels have eccentric nuts though as the following pictures show.

??? tip "V-Slot Wheels Maintenance"  

    - As the wheels will suffer from running on the aluminum and debris can build up, clean the aluminum and the wheels itself from time to time. 
    - After that, add some sythetic grease to reduce friction. Make sure you're not using grease which has graphite or MoS2 added. 
    - If you see debris building up pretty quick, it's most likely because the wheels are too close to the aluminum and therefore it's too much friction which leads to a quick wearout. So make sure the wheels are touching the aluminum but they shouldn't be too tight.
    
    !!! warning "Don't Use WD-40 For Lubrication"
    
        Do yourself a favour and *don't* use WD-40 for *lubrication* as it's *not* a lubricant and will harm your POM wheels by time!  
        People use to think WD-40 is the perfect solution for pretty much everything, but they aren't aware of the fact that -due to the chemical recipe it's made of- it's absolutely not sufficient for getting parts lubed mid- to longterm. Fact is, that the chemicals inside of it will even wash off any grease or oil, it can harm POM and rubber and so on.  
        As an example: So let's say you want to lubricate your bike chain and use WD-40 to do so, you'll basically *wash away* the existent lubrification  which is inside the chain - therefore the chain will be worn out pretty quick. You'll also harm the sealings. If you don't believe me, make a little test by yourself: take an air baloon, pump it up, spray WD-40 onto it and wait..

## Y-Axis
The X-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is belt driven. You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the front side of the aluminum profile where the bed is guided onto. The bedmount itself has v-slot wheels which are running in the v-slot of the aluminum profile.  
The following picture shows the aluminum profile of the y-axis with the knob for adjusting the belt tension at the front.

## Z-Axis
The Z-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is driven by a single lead screw, diameter 8mm with 2mm pitch per rotation. The rod is mounted to the motor by a coupler at the bottom. The top end of the rod is completely unguided, in between it's guided and secured by an anti-backlash nut which you can see at the following picture, it's the black plastic part mounted to the black steel bracket.  
  
![Z-axis views](../assets/images/z-axis_neo_web.jpg)
   
??? tip "Lead Screw Maintenance"

    - Make sure the coupler is mounted correctly and the screws are tightened. The coupler should be centered, so that the axis of the motor and the threaded rod are perfectly aligned vertically. Check from time to time that the coupler didn't come loose somehow. 
    - Make sure the rod is clean, there shouldn't stick stuff on it as it could/would block the movement. If you need to clean it, take a toothbrush or something like that to be able to reach the bottom of the thread also. It would be even better to completely disassemble the rod from the coupler and the anti-backlash nut to give it a decent cleaning. If you do so, you can clean it from the old grese by e.g. using WD-40 and a toothbrush. Make sure to not leave any particles from the anti-backlash nut or any dirt stuck on it.  
    - After you cleaned it, add a little lube to the rod. Don't be excessive here and drown it with oil - just use a tiny bit to make it glide better. I personally like to use PTFE spray first, let it dry and then put some good medium to heavy synthetic machine oil on it.

        It's perfectly fine for washing off old oil from the threaded rod, but it's *not* a sufficient lubrification!

??? note

    I noticed at my **Neo** that it's impossible for me to adjust the position in a way that leads to the circumstance that all of the three wheels are in a correct position. Both upper wheels on the outside of the profile aren't touching the profile, there always remains a little gap. Even though it seems that everything works fine, it's either a faulty design or it's intended to be like that.

## Endstop Switches
The endstop switches are triggered when either axis reaches its limits.  
So if you notice that e.g. the motor of the y axis doesn't stop when the bed reaches the end then you should check if the belonging switch is faulty. 

??? example "Checking the Switches"

    You can check if the switch really isn't working by triggering it manually while e.g. the bed is moving. If the bed doesn't stop, turn off your printer. Check the connectors at the switch and the mainboard if they're still in place. If everything looks fine here, then it's most likey that the switch itself is faulty. So disassamble the switch from the frame and put in a new one. Wire everything up again and try again triggering it manually if it works now.

## Mods

The following mods should fit both the **Go** and the **Neo** due to the mostly identical design of the printer itself. So I'm just listing them without any distinction.  
  
- Some users stabilize the rod of the Z-axis by adding a top holder/aligner with a ball bearing in the center which sits on top of the lead screw and mount the holder to the gantry to eliminate wobbling of the lead screw. For doing so, you could print a construction and add a ball bearing, there are different STL files available for this solution.  
  However, as much as it seems useful at first sight, I personally assume that it might be better if the top of the lead screw can move freely to avoid putting extra pressure on the lead screw, the frame and associated parts. If the guidance at the top doesn't allow at least minimal movement, then this could result in shear forces and even in bending the lead screw itself which would cause jamming.   
    
- Reddit member [DrumsticknDrumstick](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrumsticknDrumstick/) upgraded the z-axis of his **Neo** to a dual drive, the solution fits both the **Go** and the **Neo**: [Kobra neo/go dual Z mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/1083sr2/kobra_neogo_dual_z_mod/)  
  However, as much as I personally appreciate this mod and like this idea in general, I'm not sure if it really is a good idea as both motors and rods have to work *absolutely* simulataneously. I once tried a similar mod with my cheap little CNC machine and problems occured as soon as the movement wasn't absolutely identical anymore. However, looking at it at a 3D printer compared to a CNC of similar building architecture, I might be wrong with my concerns as there isn't any pressure applied to the printhead from the bottom side like it is when a router of a CNC machine hits the surface and cuts out material.

# Axes

## X-Axis
The X-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is belt driven. You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the right side of the aluminum profile where the printhead is guided onto.  

## Y-Axis
The X-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is belt driven. You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the front side of the aluminum profile where the bed is guided onto.  

## Z-Axis
The Z-axis of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is driven by a single rod. The rod is mounted to the motor by a coupler.  
  
!!! tip

    Make sure the coupler is mounted correctly and the screws are tightened! 

### Mods

- Some users stabilize the rod of the Z-axis by adding a top holder/aligner with a ball bearing in the center which sits on top of the rod and mount the holder to the gantry to eliminate wobbling of the rod. For doing so, you could print a construction and add a ball bearing, there are different STL files available for this solution.  
  However, as much as it seems useful at first sight, I personally assume that it might be better if the top of the rod can move freely to avoid putting extra pressure on the frame which could result in shear forces if the guidance doesn't allow at least minimal movement.   
    
- Reddit member [DrumsticknDrumstick](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrumsticknDrumstick/) upgraded the z-axis of his **Neo** to a dual drive, the solution fits both the **Go** and the **Neo**: [Kobra neo/go dual Z mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/1083sr2/kobra_neogo_dual_z_mod/)  
  However, as much as I personally appreciate this mod and like this idea in general, I'm not sure if it really is a good idea as both motors and rods have to work absolutely simulataneously. I once tried a similar mod with my cheap little CNC machine and problems occured as soon as the movement wasn't absolutely identical anymore. However, looking at it at a 3D printer compared to a CNC of similar building architecture, I might be wrong with my concerns as there isn't any pressure applied to the printhead from the bottom side like it is when a router of a CNC machine hits the surface and cuts out material.

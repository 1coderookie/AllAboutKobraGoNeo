# Printhead

## ABL sensor
Both printers come with a proximity sensor for automatic bed levelling (ABL).

If you look at the printhead from the front, you'll notice that the one of the **Go** is a bit smaller than the one from the **Neo**. The ABL sensor at the **Go** is mounted pretty much straight behind the heater block, where at the **Neo** it's located a few centimeters to the right side next to the heater block.   
  
## Extruder
The **Go** uses a bowden drive extruder, while the **Neo** is using a direct drive extruder.

If you're about to buy one of either models and you're not sure which fits you better, always go for the direct drive and get yourself the **Neo**.  
  
## Hotend

## Heater Block
Both printers use the E3D V5 compatible heater block.

Both the thermistor and the heater cartidge have to be plugged into the specific hole and should be fixed with at tiny screw (T 1.5). Make sure that you don't tighten the screw too much as it could harm both the thermistor and the heater cartridge. 

## Nozzle
Anycubic ships the printheads with a 0.4mm brass nozzle for 1.75mm filament.

The nozzle is compatible with e.g. E3D V6 nozzles.  
  
Do yourself a favour and don't buy those cheap brass nozzles where you'll get a dozen of them for a few bucks. It's just not worth it.  
Remember that the nozzle is pretty much the most crucial part when it comes down to printing and achieving good results, as it's the last link in the chain of the print process and puts out the filament.  
So go for a manufacturer who is known for quality nozzles.  
  
I personally use the E3D V6 brass nozzles for printing PLA+. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than the super cheap ones, but it's worth it - they last longer, they're precisely made and you'll get much better results. As long as you don't want to print special abrasive filaments, you're always good with these E3D V6 brass nozzles.  
  
If you want to print filaments that are more abrasive, you probably want to go nozzles made from plated copper, stainless or hardened steel, ruby sapphire nozzles and so on.  

## Silicone Sock
The silicone sock keeps isolates the hotend. The sock which comes with the printhead isn't the best one (in my opinion) to use, as it comes off pretty easily. I personally use these socks and can highly recommend them, as they have a bigger lip which covers the hotend at the top area and they are also covering the nozzle much better than the stock ones.

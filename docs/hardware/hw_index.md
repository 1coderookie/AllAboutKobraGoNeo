??? question "Got a Kobra **Go**?"  

    I'm still missing e.g. pictures of certain parts of the Kobra **Go** as I only own a **Neo**. So if you have a **Go** and would like to contribute in taking certain pictures and sen them to me I'd highly appreciate it. <br> Just send me an email to <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` <br> Thank you!

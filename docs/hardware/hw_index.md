# Hardware
This section covers the hardware topics like the mainboard, the printhead and so on. You'll find pictures and notes about the parts, how to disassamble or maintenace them and sometimes also suggestions for spare parts which could be used. Just click on the belonging chapter of the part where the desired part is located at, so e.g. in case you're looking for informations about the hotend, see the chapter "Printhead".  

??? question "Got a Go?"  

    As I only own a **Neo**, I'm still missing e.g. pictures of certain parts of the **Go**. So if you have a **Go** and would like to contribute in taking certain pictures and send them to me I'd highly appreciate it. <br> Just send me an email to <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` <br> Thank you!

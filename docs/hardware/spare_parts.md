# Spare Parts
When you need to change certain parts or to fix them, check out the [Anycubic site](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/for-kobra-series) first and watch out for the correct model.  
  
However, there are only a few parts available for the **Go** and the **Neo**. So you probably have to look around and search the web a bit.  
  
Besides the standard go-to pages when it comes down to shopping, I personally can recommend [3D Jake](www.3djake.com) (I'm *not* affiliated though!) as I'm very pleased with them.  
They offer a broad spectrum of original spare parts (even some parts you can't get at Anycubic's shop - weird but true), third party parts, filament, tools and other useful accessories for a fair price. They ship pretty fast in many countries and when you reach a certain order value they even ship for free. On top of that, they are really nice when you have to contact them and they answer asap.

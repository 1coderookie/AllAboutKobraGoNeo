# Spare Parts
When you need to change certain parts or you need to fix them, check out the [Anycubic site](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/for-kobra-series) first and watch out for the correct printer model.  
However, there are only a few parts available for the **Go** and the **Neo** at the time of writing this. So you probably have to look around and search the web a bit.  
  
!!! tip

    Besides the standard go-to pages when it comes down to shopping, I personally can recommend **[3D Jake](https://www.3djake.com)** (I'm not affiliated) as I'm very pleased with them. <br> This company is located in Austria and offers a broad spectrum of original spare parts (even some parts you can't get at Anycubic's shop - weird but true), third party spare parts, filament, tools and other useful accessories for a fair price. <br> They ship pretty fast to many countries and when you reach a certain order value they even ship for free. <br> On top of that, they are really nice when you have to contact them and they answer asap.

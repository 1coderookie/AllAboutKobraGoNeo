# Bed
Both of the printers have a heated and magnetic bed with the dimensions of 220x220mm.  
It should reach about ≤230°F/110°C maximum and therefore it should be possible to successfully print ABS, PETG and TPU (by using a housing though) besides PLA.  
The bed uses a removable PEI-coated spring steel plate which makes it easy to remove the printed object. The plate that comes with the printer is one-sided coated at the **Go** and double-sided coated at the **Neo**.   
Both printers offer a 25-point automatic bed leveling which is called "Anycubic LeviQ".  
  
The following picture shows the surface of the coated plate from a close-up view.

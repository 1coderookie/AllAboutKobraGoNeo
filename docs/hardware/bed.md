# Bed
Both of the printers have a heated and magnetic bed with the dimensions of 220x220mm. It should reach about 110°C maximum and therefore it should be possible to successfully print PETG and TPU (by using a housing though). The bed uses a removable PEI-coated spring steel plate which makes it easy to remove the printed object from it. The following picture shows the surface from a close-up view.

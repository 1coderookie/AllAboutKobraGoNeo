# Mainboard

## TriGorilla V_3.0.6 (Stock) 
  
The stock mainboard of both the **Go** and the **Neo** is the "TriGorilla V_3.0.6", it's just flashed with the respective fimware of either model. 
      
Afaik it is a 32bit mainboard with a Huada HC32F460 200MHz ARM Cortex-M4 with 192KB SRAM and 512KB Flash. The mainboard comes with TMC2208 silent stepper drivers soldered onto the board. It offers a microSD card reader and a USB-C connector.

??? tip 
  
    - As both the **Go** and the **Neo** use the same mainboard, you can just get yourself the mainboard for the **Go** if you e.g. own a **Neo** and can't get a mainboard for it (at the time of writing this, Anycubic only offers the mainboard for the **Go** in their shop) or if you find a seller but he charges more for the **Neo** version. You just need to flash the specific firmware for the **Neo** before using the printer. 
  
    - *It's advisable to cut off the soldered tips of the wires without a plug (power supply and heated bed) and add ferrules to them.* When you are screwing down the soldered tip inside the clamp, it may get deformed a bit and in case the wire gets warm and the solder gets softer, the contact may become loose which could lead to malfunction or even cause fire in the last consequence. So it's always a good idea to just use proper ferrules. <br> ![Ferrules instead of soldered tips](../assets/images/mainboard_ferrules_web.jpg)  
  
    - *Shortcuts coming from the cartridge heater for example can/will damage your mainboard, so be careful to never cause a shortcut somehow!* A common misbehaviour is to clean the nozzle with a little brass brush during the print process or while everything is heating up. Also grabbing the heater block to e.g. change the nozzle while everything is heating up and electrical current is flowing is another common mistake. When using the pliers to hold the heater block, the tips of the pliers may touch the contacts of the wires at the cartridge heater and you cause a shortcut. As a result you can/will get blown up part at the mainboard like the melted part "D4" as shown in the picture below. <br> ![Melted D4 caused by a shortcut](../assets/images/mainboard_melted-D4_web.jpg)

## SKR3 (Mod)
??? question "Got a SKR3?"  

    Did you already replace the stock mainboard with a BTT SKR3? If so, it would be great if you'd share your knowledge and contribute a little description and probably a picture of the built in board. <br> Just send me an email to <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` <br> Thank you!

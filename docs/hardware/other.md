# Other

Here you can find whatever didn't seem to fit in one of the other chapters.  
  
## Mods
In the following I'll list mods or STL files I found which could be interesting in general. Keep in mind that they mostly should fit for both printers in general due to the identical design and contruction itself, so (right now) I don't separate them into **Go** and **Neo** like usually.    

- [Gregg Bennett](https://www.printables.com/de/social/221278-greg-bennett) created [risers](https://www.printables.com/de/model/394918-anycubic-kobra-neo-risers) which slip on the feet of the printer to rise up the whole construction allowing a better airflow for the fans of the mainboard and the power supply unit.  
- [Lohtex](https://www.printables.com/de/social/546846-lohtex) created [bed spacers](https://www.printables.com/de/model/376710-anycubic-kobra-go-bed-spacers) which could be used to replace the stock ones if they're completely different in their size.  
  However, keep in mind though that also the bottomside of the bed will get warm and therefore the spacers might become deformed if using PLA, so make sure you're printing them with e.g. ABS. Also keep in mind that prints aren't 100% correct in their dimensions, so that printing spacers won't be the final solution to get your bed perfectly trammed.   
- [Stellar5](https://www.printables.com/de/social/407998-stellar5) created a [purge/drip tray](https://www.printables.com/de/model/351007-anycubic-kobra-go-purgedrip-tray) which can be mounted to the frame and prevents filament from falling underneath the printer while heating up in home position.
- [ZAch Goldberg](https://www.printables.com/de/social/457330-zach-goldberg) created a [sidemount](https://www.printables.com/de/model/334261-anycubic-kobra-go-side-mount) which can be mounted underneath the holder of the control unit and offers some mounting options for e.g. a Raspberry Pi.

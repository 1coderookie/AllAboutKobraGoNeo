# Filament Runout Sensor

The filament runout sensor (aka filament break detection) available from Anycubic is optional, it doesn't come with the printer right away. It seems to be pretty much plug&play as it should come with the specific wires and plugs.  
  
However, I'm still waiting for mine to come, so I can't support you with pictures or installation steps right now, so maybe just come back another time.

# Filament Sensor

The filament runout or break detection sensor available from Anycubic is optional, it doesn't come with the printer right away. It seems to be pretty much plug&play as it should come with the specific wires and plugs. After stripping in the wires and lead them down to the mainboard, you then have to plug it in the corresponding socket which (up to me) should be this green one in the following picture as it's the only one available.

I'm not sure yet if you have to activate something after installing it or if it just works right away though.  
However, after you connected and mounted the sensor, you lead the filament through it. If the filament runs out because it broke or the spool is empty, the printer will pause.

    After doing some research I personally came to the conclusion that (at this time) I'm not going to get this sensor because I've read too many posts from different users complaining about false detections and therefore paused prints even though there was filament loaded. This might just be a small problem which probably could easily be fixed by bending the little lever of the switch inside of the sensorbox so that there's more pressure onto the filament, but right now I don't feel to go that route.  
    However, if you got yourself the sensor and installed it or even opened the little plastic box and looked inside of it, I'd be happy if you'd get in touch with me (email: `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de`) so that I could add some pictures of it here and a little description about how to activate it if certain steps would be necessary to do so.

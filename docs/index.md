**Welcome to my page about Anycubic's "Kobra Go" and "Kobra Neo" 3D FDM printers.**   
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a **Kobra Neo** from a friend of mine. As it came with some problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the **Neo** - it turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family. So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the **Go** and **Neo** (as they are basically the same) to facilitate other newbies like me an easier start right away.

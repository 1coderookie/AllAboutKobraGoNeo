**Hi and welcome to my little page about the 3D FDM printers "Kobra Go" and "Kobra Neo" from Anycubic.**   
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a **Kobra Neo** from a friend of mine.  
As it came with some problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the **Neo**.  
It turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family - most of the (still rare) informations were about the Kobra **Go**.  
So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the **Go** and **Neo** (as they are basically the same) to facilitate other newbies like me an easier start right away.  
  
??? question "Want to contribute?"  

    If you'd like to contribute - please let me know, I'd highly appreciate it. <br> You don't necessarily need a GitHub account for it - just send me an email to  <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` <br> and we'll figure something out.  
  
*Happy printing!*

# Hi and welcome to my little page about the 3D printers "Kobra Go" and "Kobra Neo" from Anycubic.  
  
I am a newbie to 3D printing and got a Kobra Neo from a friend of mine.  
As it came with some minor problems and needed a bit of tinker love, I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the Neo. It turned out that it wasn't an easy mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family - most of the (still rare) informations were about the Kobra Go. So I thought it might be a good idea to document my tinkering and collect informations and tips about the Go and Neo, as they are basically the same - looking at the hardware, afaik the only difference is the print head / extruder (Go has a bowden and Neo has a direct drive extruder).  
  
This page isn't supposed to discuss individual problems like "I still get stringing, what can I do?" - therefore many forums exist.  
It's supposed to be seen as a general source of informations about these two models.  
However, if you've found out certain settings which work in general (e.g. certain g-codes for the stop/end section), if you discovered mods which aren't listed here or if you found out that certain things just don't work or even harm the printer - you're more than welcome to share them.   
  
May these informations help some newbies like me to get off better from the start and to take care of problems like a broken thermistor or a broken heating element of the extruder or even a broken mainboard (which happened to me all together - nice start).  
  
If you'd like to contribute - please let me know.  
You don't necessarily need a GitHub account for it if you don't want to register here for free, just send me an email to  <br> `3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de` </br> and we'll figure something out.   
  
Happy printing!
